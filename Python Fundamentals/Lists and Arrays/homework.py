# Exercise for Lists and Arrays: Homework Solution

import numpy as np                          # we import the Numpy library and give it abbreviation "np"

L4 = [[2, 9, -5], [-1, 0, 4], [3, 1, 2]]    # this is once again our L4 list

mean = np.mean(L4)                          # this method from Numpy class let's us easily calculate the mean of an array/list

print(mean)                                 # we display the mean calculated by function above
